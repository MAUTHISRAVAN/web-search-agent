# web-search-agent
Our search agent works through several key components:

1. Tools: The DuckDuckGo search tool allows the agent to search the internet for information.

2. Language Model: The ChatOpenAI model processes queries and search results intelligently.

3. Agent: The ReAct agent follows a thought process of:

Understanding the question
Deciding what information is needed
Using tools to gather information
Formulating a response
4. Memory: The ConversationBufferMemory allows the agent to maintain context across multiple interactions.

Best Practices and Tips

1. API Key Security: Always use environment variables for API keys

2. Temperature Setting: Adjust the temperature parameter to control response creativity

3. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for API calls

4. Rate Limiting: Be mindful of API rate limits

Conclusion

Perform web searches
